# Tsunami

Tsunami is an open-source digital audio workstation (DAW). It is designed for ease of use and not-looking-crappyâ„¢.

## Features

It was mostly developed for my personal home recording needs, i.e.
 * multi-track mixing
 * multi-version audio recording
 * audio effects
 * midi editing
 * synthesizers
 * samples
 * plugin system
 * persistent sessions

### Plugin system

Tsunami uses its own just-in-time compiler for plugin code. Currently, this mostly works on x86/amd64 CPUs.

## Getting started
