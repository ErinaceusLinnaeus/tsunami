# Tsunami

Tsunami is an open-source *Digital Audio Workstation* (DAW). It is designed for ease of use and not-looking-crappyâ„¢.

Written for Linux, can also run on Windows and MacOS.

## Features

It was mostly developed for my personal home recording needs, i.e.
 * multi-track mixing
 * multi-version audio recording
 * audio effects
 * midi editing
 * synthesizers
 * samples
 * plugin system
 * signal chains
 * persistent sessions

### Plugin system

Tsunami uses its own [language](https://github.com/momentarylapse/kaba) and just-in-time compiler for plugin code. Only x86_64 and aarch64 CPUs are supported.
